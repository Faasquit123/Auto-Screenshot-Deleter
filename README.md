# Auto-Screenshot-Deleter-ASD-
Made for Red Alliance Speedrunning

Put the file run.bat into the Red Alliance folder (f.ex. E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Red Alliance)! You can also make a shortcut to the run.bat and put the shortcut on your Desktop! (Do not run the file as administrator as it will not work if ran as administrator!)
